# Python-Input-Library-Speed-Test
Python Input Speed Test: Compare 'mouse', 'pyautogui', and 'pynput' libraries for moving the mouse cursor. Measure speed and performance with on-screen instructions. Useful for understanding relative efficiency. Contributions welcome.

This repository contains a simple Python script designed to compare the speed of different input libraries for moving the mouse cursor. The script allows you to test three different libraries: 'mouse', 'pyautogui', and 'pynput'. It measures the time taken for each library to move the mouse cursor by a small distance and displays the results.

Libraries Tested:

'mouse': This library is used to move the mouse cursor by a specified amount with the mouse.move() function.
'pyautogui': This library is used to move the mouse cursor by a specified amount with the pyautogui.move() function.
'pynput': This library is used to move the mouse cursor by a specified amount with the pynput.mouse.Controller class.
Instructions:

Run the Python script and follow the on-screen instructions.
Press 'A', 'B', or 'C' to test the respective library's mouse movement speed.
Press 'Q' to quit the program.
Please note that this test is only intended to compare the relative speed of mouse movement using different libraries and should not be considered a comprehensive benchmark. The results may vary based on the system's hardware, operating system, and other factors.

Feel free to use this repository to explore and compare the mouse movement performance of these Python libraries and contribute any improvements or additional libraries if desired.
